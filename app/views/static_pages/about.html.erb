    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This website was created as part of my web development learning process, 
    also with intention to better myself at writing articles however in the 
    process I decided to make it to help other people who want to become web 
    developers also and guide them through the process, give advise and motivation 
    from my own learning experience.

        My journey in to programming started around 2010 after coming across a 
        video lectures on youtube from Stanford University called "Programming
        Methodology in java 
        (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMDCCdjyW8&list=PLB727981776561EB5&index=1">here</a>)"
        . I was blown away by the proffessor Mehran Sahami and after finishing 
        those lectures I thought to mysel - wow finally I found something that I
        am really interested in.
